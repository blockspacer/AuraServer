# AuraServer

Take a look first at the base project: https://github.com/gpascualg/Shinzui

### What is this?

**Shinzui** is a general purpouse mmo-server core, while **AuraServer** is a derived project specialized for a MMORPG/RTS game. Note that any limitation on Shinzui (as can be read in its README) also applies to AuraServer.


Although this project can be considered as a proof of concept, it is already capable of:

* Handling connections

* Handling player movements and NPCs movements (via randomized bezier curves)

* Handling player attack input (ie. firing canons in the context of this game)

* Handling impacts from bullets/canons and taking damage

A github token might be found in this repo, it is no longer valid.
